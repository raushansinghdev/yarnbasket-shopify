# Decision log

Newest first. Each entry says what was decided and why, so later work doesn't reopen it by accident.

## 2026-10-01

- **Team is two:** Raushan (owner, software developer, new to Shopify) and Claude. No separate SEO owner, so Claude flags SEO-sensitive changes in each pull request and Raushan approves them.
- **Base theme: Shopify's Skeleton theme** (https://github.com/Shopify/skeleton-theme), chosen by Claude after Raushan delegated the choice. It's a minimal Online Store 2.0 starter with nothing to strip out. Dawn and Horizon are kept only as references for the accessible cart drawer, predictive search, filters and variant picker.
- **Launch dates confirmed:** soft launch 30 Nov 2026 (password shared with friends and family), public launch Mon 7 Dec 2026.
- **Home page first.** Then collection and search, product page, cart, and content pages.
- **Uncluttered by rule:** 9 home sections, max 8 products in any home row, one idea and one main button per section, fixed spacing scale. The full spec is in `build-plan.html`.
- **Visual language comes from the brand kit's Instagram grid:** Blush / Cocoa / Oat surfaces, stitch borders, photo-frame product cards, the kit's line icons, and the yarn-strand animation. See `brand-direction.md`.
- **Accessibility target WCAG 2.2 AA.** A new "Taupe Ink" #705B52 is used for small text because Taupe fails contrast. The focus ring is Cocoa, not Rose.
- **Shopify store:** a client transfer store at `yarnbasket-in.myshopify.com` (Partner org "Yarn Basket"). It's free until launch, then gets transferred and moved to a paid plan.

## 2026-09-28

- **Custom Liquid theme, not Hydrogen.** Shopify's native SEO (sitemap, canonical tags, redirects, meta fields) matters more than headless freedom on a new domain, and the theme editor lets content be changed without code.
- **Coming-soon page** on GitHub Pages at yarnbasket.in with a "Shop on Meesho" button, until launch.
- **Meesho app deep link dropped.** Meesho's app links don't cover store pages. The button stays a plain web link.

## Still open

- **Differentiator:** the proposal is "made by hand" storytelling plus gifting (occasions, gift note, wrap). Needed by 12 Oct.
- **Launch range:** 15–25 products. Needed in week 2.
- **Payment gateway and COD:** the proposal is Razorpay plus partial COD. Needed in week 2.
